## Introduction

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system that enables you to create professional-looking documents.
This repository provides a template .tex file, along with the necessary files, to help you create your resume as quickly as possible.

## Getting Started

To get started, could you make sure you have LaTeX installed on your system? If not, refer to the installation instructions provided on the [LaTeX official website](https://www.latex-project.org/get/). Once you have LaTeX installed, clone this repository to access the files.

## Notes

There are three files you can work with.
The first file is **resume.cls** which has all the settings your resume file should have. If you're not familiar with the commands in this file, **TRY NOT TO CHANGE THIS FILE.**

The second file is the **your-cd.text**. You can change the parts in this file to anything you desire. All parts are commented on and have an example for you.

The third file is **GPA-Calculator.xlsx**, an Excel file designed to quickly and easily calculate your GPA. You may need this file to complete your resume.
 
To work better, you may need to install **TeX Live** (Windows, Linux). This distribution contains a complete TeX system with LaTeX itself and editors to write documents.

You can also work with online LaTeX services.

## Next Step

After making any changes to **your-cv.tex**, you can compile this file. This will give you a PDF file.
An example PDF file is located at the address [**your-cv.pdf**](your-cv.pdf)
